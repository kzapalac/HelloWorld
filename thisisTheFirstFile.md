## This is the first file I am adding to my repository

The file contains text. No code. The file has the extension .md. The exstension .md stands for MarkDown.

.md files are very common on GitHub. We wil learn about them later!

## Experimentation with MarkDown:

### Creating a table
| This | is | a | table | header |
| --- | --- | --- | ----| ---|
| this | is | the | table's | content |
| more | content | is | shown | here |

### Font types
**This is bold text**

*This text is italicized*

~~This was mistaken text~~

**This is _extremely_ important**

***All this text is important***


Here is a link to more formatting options using MarkDown: [link](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
